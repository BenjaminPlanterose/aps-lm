## Reproducibility report

A reproducibility report that includes R-scripts, raw simulated data and aps-lm models for epigenetic aging prediction with example datasets are available [here](https://github.com/BenjaminPlanterose/aps-lm/blob/main/reproducibility_report_v2.zip). 

The reproducibility report contains several folders and files, the structure of which and instructions on how to run it are included in *README.html*. The main file of the report consists of the Rmarkdown file *reproducibility_report.Rmd*.

For any questions/concerns, either [report an issue](https://github.com/BenjaminPlanterose/aps-lm/issues) or simply contact b.planterosejimenez at gmail.com
